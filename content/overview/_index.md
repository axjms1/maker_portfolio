This portfolio is organized in a clear and logical manner, simply click on the buttons above to navigate to each section.  I have several projects from the course listed under the projects tab that are based on Scratch and Makey-Makey.  I really enjoyed the instructional unit proposal in which I explored working with the Arduino platform.  If you are so inclined you may enjoy looking over the projects in there.  Also, if you are looking for something specific I have tried to tag each project and page on the website appropriately so you can use the Tags page to navigate and sort those items quickly.
