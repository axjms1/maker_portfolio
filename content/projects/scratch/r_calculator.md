This project was a lot of fun and also very annoying.  It was fun because I was able to do something useful with scratch and enjoyed setting up a custom background while working with multiple variables.  It was challenging becuase it is quite difficult to do complex calculations with the drag and drop interface of Scratch.  I really wish we could just type things in!
