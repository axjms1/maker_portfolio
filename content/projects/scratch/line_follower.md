I spent a lot of time on this scratch experimenting with different ways to achieve my goals.  The first thing I wanted to do was to accurately track the lap time of the cat as they ran around the track.  The second thing I wanted to do was figure out a way to have the cat stop if they fell off the track.  Both of those things were implemented using color sensing but I am sure there is more than one way to skin a cat. Finally, I had to implement a method to enable the user to increase the speed of the cat or they would never fall off the track.  The code shown is a little small because there is quite a bit happening but feel free to take a closer look by clicking on one of the links above.
